**Proton-autogen automatically creates and configures Proton environments for Windows games and applications, applying optimized settings for the best compatibility.**
**Proton-autogen is a lightweight Proton/Wine orchestration layer that allows Linux users to run Windows applications from `.exe` files without manually managing Steam shortcuts or Wine prefixes.**


Run Windows executables through Proton with zero Steam configuration.

## 📦 Downloads

Latest releases are available on GitHub:

- Debian / Ubuntu: `.deb` package
- Source installation: `install.sh`
- Arch Linux / CachyOS: AUR (coming soon)


## 📦 Installation & Updates

### Ubuntu / Linux Mint / Pop!_OS (Recommended)

The recommended installation method is the official Proton-Autogen PPA:

For Arch Linux and CachyOS, a native package is planned.
Until then, the manual installer is available.

### Recommended installation (Ubuntu / Linux Mint / Pop!_OS)

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:n3oray/proton-autogen
sudo apt update
sudo apt install proton-autogen
```

### Debian / Ubuntu-based distributions (.deb package)

Download the latest `.deb` release from GitHub:
```bash
sudo apt install ./proton-autogen_*.deb
```
### Build Debian package manually

```bash
git clone https://github.com/N3oRay/proton-autogen.git
cd proton-autogen
dpkg-buildpackage -b -us -uc
sudo apt install ../proton-autogen_*.deb
```

### See the manual installation guide:
[Installation Guide](docs/install.md)


Review the installer before running it
```bash
less install.sh
```
### (install manual)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/N3oRay/proton-autogen.git
cd proton-autogen
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```


### Config
The configuration is fully automatic.
```bash
cat ~/.config/proton-autogen/proton-autogen.conf
ls ~/.config/proton-autogen/games
```


This installs:

* `/usr/bin/proton-autogen`
* Integrated with Nemo (Cinnamon), Nautilus (GNOME), and Dolphin (KDE Plasma).

---

## ⚠️ Requirements

### Required

* Python 3.x
* A working Proton installation

Supported locations:

```text
~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d
~/.steam/debian-installation/compatibilitytools.d
~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d
```

### Optional

- GameMode
- MangoHud
- GameScope
- Proton-CachyOS
- GE-Proton
- ProtonUp-Qt
```bash
sudo apt install gamemode mangohud
```
---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Detect available Proton installations
2. Prefer GE-Proton when available
3. Launch executable through Proton
4. Fall back to Wine if Proton runtime tools are unavailable
5. Optionally enable GameMode

No Steam shortcut creation is required.

---

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

### Remove Package

```bash
sudo apt remove proton-autogen
```

### Full Cleanup

```bash
sudo apt purge proton-autogen
```

### Manual Cleanup

```bash
chmod +x ./uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```
The uninstall script only removes Proton-Autogen files and configuration.
It does not remove Steam, Proton versions, or existing Wine prefixes.

Restart Nemo:

```bash
nemo -q
```

Restart Nautilus:

```bash
nautilus -q
```

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

* Not every Windows application works under Proton
* Some launchers require additional configuration
* Proton compatibility depends on the selected Proton version
* Certain applications may still require Wine tweaks

## 🤝 Contributing

Bug reports, feature requests, and contributions are welcome.

Please use GitHub Issues for discussions and reports.


## 💡 Philosophy

Linux gaming is powerful but often fragmented.

Proton-Autogen aims to reduce friction by turning Proton into a transparent execution layer rather than a manually configured tool.

The goal is simple:

> Right-click → Run Windows application → It just works.
