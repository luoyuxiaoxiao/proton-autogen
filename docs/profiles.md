# Community Profiles Database

Proton-Autogen includes a community-maintained game profile database (`profiles.csv`) used to automatically select the best runtime profile for known Windows games and applications.

Everyone is welcome to contribute. No Python knowledge is required.

## Profiles

Profiles allow you to customize the execution environment for specific applications or games without modifying Proton-Autogen itself.

They are intended to make it easy to reuse environment variables, compatibility settings, and launch options across multiple applications. Whether you want to improve compatibility, optimize performance, or maintain separate configurations for different games, profiles provide a simple and reusable solution.

If you plan to contribute new built-in profiles or improve existing ones, please read the project's contribution guidelines first:

## Location

System database:

```text
/usr/share/proton-autogen/profiles.csv
```

User overrides:

```text
~/.config/proton-autogen/profiles.csv
```

Entries in the user database automatically override entries from the system database.

## CSV Format

```csv
exe,game,exe_type,notes
```

## Adding a New Game

Submit a Pull Request and it can become part of the official database.

## Tips

* Use only the executable filename (not the full path).
* Profile names are case-sensitive.
* One executable per line.
* Keep notes short and informative.
* If a game has multiple executables, add one entry for each executable.

Community contributions help Proton-Autogen recognize more games and provide better default settings for everyone.
